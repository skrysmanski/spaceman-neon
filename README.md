# Spaceman Neon

"Spaceman Neon" is a dark theme specifically designed for terminals.

I have several requirements that an ideal dark theme for terminals would need to satisfy:

**Hard Requirements:**

* Different colors for all 16 ANSI colors. (Often dark themes use the same color for the dark and the bright variant of a color.)
* Dark gray (bright black) must be readable (on the theme's dark background).

**Nice-to-have:**

* Colors match their names (e.g. blue is not reinterpreted as purple)
* All colors are different enough to be easily distinguishable; this is especially challenging with the combination blue/cyan/gray/white where cyan is often similar either to blue or to white/gray.

Spaceman Neon tries to satisfy all of these requirements.
